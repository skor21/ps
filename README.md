Updated port scanner with GUI and status bar

When you launch, GUI screen appears. Type in target. The next line asks you to input number of ports to scan or
'a' for all Unfortunately, the text box is covering instructions. You can still input number of ports or 'a'

After you select 'scan' the GUI box is supposed to minimize.

Everything else seems to work great. We have a progress bar, and everything looks good. 

Just these two things I think need to be fixed.
